<p>Greetings and Welcome to Cinder GL 101! This series of tutorials is designed to give you an introduction to working with Cinder’s OpenGL wrapper to create simple 3D content in Cinder. If you’ve used openFrameworks, processing, or other creative coding frameworks, you’ll notice that Cinder does things a little bit differently, but once you understand the basics, you’ll be able to create awesome 3D visuals very quickly and easily. As Andrew Bell, creator of Cinder, says, “Cinder makes easy things easy and hard things possible,” and the new 3D interfaces are no exception</p>

<p>A few things about this tutorial:</p>

<ol>
<li>I’m going to assume that you have at least a cursory familiarity with C++ and programming in general, so I’m not going to spend too much time explaining C++ particularities.</li>
<li>I’m not going to assume that you’ve done any work with OpenGL “Modern (3.2-3.3+)” or otherwise, but I’m not going to spend too much time explaining OpenGL particularities in-line either. However, I will provide links back to some useful OpenGL tutorials that probably explain some of the concepts better than I can.</li>
<li>I assume you’ve done at least a little bit of work with Visual Studio, i.e. you can open a solution file, navigate the basics of the UI, and build and run projects.</li>
<li>I’ve only tested these on Windows, but they should work on Mac OS just fine. As I don’t have access to a Mac OS box, I can’t provide XCode projects (unless someone wants to donate a Macbook ;)), but I love pull requests!</li>
</ol>

<p>Alright, we’re almost ready to get started, so here’s what you’ll need to go through this tutorial series:</p>

<ol>
<li>Visual Studio 2013+, any version. I’ve tested these against Professional, Ultimate, Community Edition, and 2015 RC, so you should be covered, no matter what your compiler price range. <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx">Get VS Community Edition</a>
</li>
<li>Cinder master or glNext, which at the time of this writing are effectively the same thing. The current publicly available download version is 0.8.6, but as these tutorials are designed for glNext, you’ll need to get ahold of the master branch from github (which we’ll cover in the first tutorial).</li>
<li>A bit of creativity and inquisitiveness. One of the things I absolutely encourage when going through these tutorials is exploration! So if you’re going through a particular lesson and it inspires an idea, branch off and try it! And if you get stuck with a particular lesson or idea, you’ll also need…</li>
<li>My contact info, hit me up on either of these channels, and we’ll get you unstuck!

<p>Whew! All that said, let’s make some shiny things!</p>
